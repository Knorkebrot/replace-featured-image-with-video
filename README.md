replace-featured-image-with-video
=================================

This is a fork of [PurpleTurtle's replace-featured-image-with-video][svn],
which seems to be abandoned. Unfortunately noone was able to buy the pro
version from a guy who disappeared, so this fork is just about removing
the need for the product key. (The original project is GPLv2 licensed.)

You can find the original README in the readme.txt file.
